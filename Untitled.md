## Week 11 Rust Demo - Longest Increasing Subsequence Finder

In this week, what I did is a Rust implementation of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem. The code uses dynamic programming to find the LIS of a given sequence and includes error handling for user input. You can use as following example:

```
Longest Increasing Subsequence Finder
Enter a sequence of integers separated by spaces:
4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 9 4 3 1
The length of the longest increasing subsequence is: 5
